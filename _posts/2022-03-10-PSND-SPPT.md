title: "Spatial point pattern test for Project Safe Neighborhoods:
  Dallas"
---



The map below is part of a project examining the effectiveness of
Dallas’s Project Safe Neighborhoods initiative. The map shows the
results of a spatial point pattern test examining what areas experienced
changes in violent crime.

The target areas are indicated by a red border. The spatial point
pattern test was performed on the city of Dallas as well as the
municipalities neighboring the target area (Cockrell Hill, Garland,
Highland Park, Richardson, and University Park) for the 12 months before
vs. after the launch of Dallas’s Project Safe Neighborhoods initiative
in April 2018. The test was performed at the level of the smallest
administrative regions available (Dallas Police Department patrol beats
for Dallas and city/town boundaries for other municipalities). Due to
the large number of regions tested, the p-values were adjusted to
control for the false discovery rate.
